There was too much complexity in status-term. It will be much easier to create
different widgets if they are all stand alone.

The plan is to envoke widgets through this single application, pass some
parameters, and launch a given widget.

Each widget can be launched in its own terminal session, wich will look nice and
pretty with a tiled widow manager.

## Installation

Clone the repository and do a lein run.

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    $ java -jar widgets-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

## Options

FIXME: listing of options this app accepts.

## Examples
